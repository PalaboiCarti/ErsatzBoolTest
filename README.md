I have a local repo with a venv in it with all the dependencies I need for this to work.
The only dependencies you need is pandas.

Heres how to install that shit
```python 
pip install virtualenv
```

Change your directory into your local repo and type this into your terminal
```python 
virtualenv venv
```

in your virtual environment, install pandas
```python
pip install pandas
```

Also, if you're using venv, DO NOT use git with the (venv) terminal. Always use gitbash for git. Use venv for running scripts or installing packages only.

changed repo name, testing if it works rn.
