#Okay it works
I have a local repo with a venv in it with all the dependencies I need for this to work.

Man if u want just make ur own venv and install pandas in there. With that it should work. I made this frustrated asl hence the "gfys" repo name.

Also, if you're using venv, DO NOT use git with the (venv) terminal. Always use gitbash for git. Use venv for running scripts or installing packages only.

If you make updates on readme or whatever its best u do it here. Man, fetching main and shit like that then merging origin an branch? who gives a fuck about that? i dont. so yeah.

changed repo name, testing if it works rn.
